## About Dataset
### Content
This dataset is designed for learning customer segmentation concepts, such as market basket analysis. It includes basic customer data such as Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score, which is assigned based on customer behavior and purchasing data.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to help a supermarket mall owner understand their customers better, identify target customers who are likely to converge, and provide insights to the marketing team for strategic planning.

## Steps Performed:
1. Data Exploration
  * Checked for duplicate values
  * Checked for missing values
  * Checking the Distribution of Variables

2. Feature Engineering
  * Performed <b>Label Encoding<b/> to convert categorical variables into numeric values
3. Finding Optimal K-value
  * Performed WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Square) to find the optimal k_vlaue
